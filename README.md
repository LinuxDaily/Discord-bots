# Discord-bots
This is the storefront of the discord bots I have written for my discord server at https://discord.gg/wMHaEgW

ldai.py is the code for "LinuxDaily's AI Counterpart" in order for certain commands to work, you need to create a directory on the system you're running the bot on '/etc/lists/ and make a few wordlists there, the bot will tell you
karen.py is the code for "Karen Bot". This one complains about everything, caution as it can be quite spammy and annoying
scoreboard.py is a chat scoreboard. it'll give you points on how much you speak
